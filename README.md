Limitation Notice:
Due to the current data extraction approach, if multiple tables are present on the same row or share overlapping row identifiers, the data may not be fetched or processed accurately. This limitation affects scenarios where visual layout merges or aligns different table contents horizontally, leading to ambiguous or incomplete row matching. We recommend ensuring each table is structured independently and clearly separated to ensure accurate data retrieval.
